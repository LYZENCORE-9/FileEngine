# FileEngine ! üóÉÔ∏è ‚öôÔ∏è (‚ö†Ô∏è In Progress) 
It's a cross-platform C/C++ library which includes multiple libraries for prossessing files like INI (only at this time) , CFG, IMG, NoSQL and more in future  
## Getting Started  üöÄ
## Prerequisites  
* C & C++ Compiler (GCC/LLVM Clang) (MSVC i don't know)  
* CMake  
* Make or Ninja build system   
## Libraries  
### INI
